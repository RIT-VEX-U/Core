/*
 * MovingAverage
 *
 * A moving average is a way of smoothing out noisy data. For many sensor readings, the noise is roughly symmetric
 * around the actual value. This means that if you collect enough samples those that are too high are cancelled out by
 * the samples that are too low leaving the real value.
 *
 * The MovingAverage class provides a simple interface to do this smoothing from our noisy sensor values.
 *
 * WARNING: because we need a lot of samples to get the actual value, the value given by the MovingAverage will 'lag'
 * behind the actual value that the sensor is reading. Using a MovingAverage is thus a tradeoff between accuracy and lag
 * time (more samples) vs. less accuracy and faster updating (less samples).
 *
