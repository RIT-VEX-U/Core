/**
 * Odometry3Wheel
 *
 * This class handles the code for a standard 3-pod odometry setup, where there are 3 "pods" made up of undriven
 * (dead) wheels connected to encoders in the following configuration:
 *
 *  +Y   ---------------
 *  ^    |             |
 *  |    |             |
 *  |    | ||   O   || |
 *  |    |             |
 *  |    |     ===     |
 *  |    ---------------
 *  |
 *  +-------------------> + X
 *
 * Where O is the center of rotation. The robot will monitor the changes in rotation of these wheels and calculate
 * the robot's X, Y and rotation on the field.
 *
 * This is a "set and forget" class, meaning once the object is created, the robot will immediately begin
 * tracking it's movement in the background.
