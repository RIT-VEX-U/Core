/**
 * Autochooser is a utility to make selecting robot autonomous programs easier
 * source: RIT VexU Wiki
 * During a season, we usually code between 4 and 6 autonomous programs.
 * Most teams will change their entire robot program as a way of choosing autonomi
 * but this may cause issues if you have an emergency patch to upload during a competition.
 * This class was built as a way of using the robot screen to list autonomous programs, and the touchscreen to select
 * them.
