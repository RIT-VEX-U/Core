/**
 * Trapezoid Profile
 *
 * This is a motion profile defined by an acceleration, maximum velocity, start point and end point.
 * Using this information, a parametric function is generated, with a period of acceleration, constant
 * velocity, and deceleration. The velocity graph looks like a trapezoid, giving it it's name.
 *
 * If the maximum velocity is set high enough, this will become a S-curve profile, with only acceleration and
 * deceleration.
 *
 * This class is designed for use in properly modelling the motion of the robots to create a feedfoward
 * and target for PID. Acceleration and Maximum velocity should be measured on the robot and tuned down
 * slightly to account for battery drop.
 *
 * Here are the equations graphed for ease of understanding:
